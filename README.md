This was a hack and roll 2023 project based on using the raspberry pi equipeed with sensors to
monitor organ data and based on the type of body part and notify amubulance passngers about the condition of the 
body part, either stable, unstable, severely unstable. This data was also sent to a website by Thingspeak(IOT bridge) to display the data for doctors 
and others interested in part vitals not actually in the transport vehichle. The second part of this project was using an ML model to form a dataset
extracted from a random database to find the top 10 best matches for donor to recipeint in a certian geological area this info was also dumped onto 
the rasppi screen for drivers to know who the recpeint of the organ is and the distance with functionality to scroll through the people on the list, as 
parts are delivered to recipients hospitals.
